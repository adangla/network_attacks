When it receive a frame a hub repeat it on all its ports and a switch will
send it on the port where the destination is, as illustrated below.
### Example:
![Hub operation](https://github.com/adangla/network_attacks/raw/master/mac_flooding/img/hub.png "Hub operation")
![Switch operation](https://github.com/adangla/network_attacks/raw/master/mac_flooding/img/switch.png "Switch operation")

So the next question is how the switch does that?
